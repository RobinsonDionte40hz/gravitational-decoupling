[1] We carried out back‐projections of teleseismic data
filtered in different frequency bands for the 2010 Maule,
Chile and the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquakes. For the
Maule earthquake, there were differences along strike of the
fault, with the high‐frequency energy mainly originating
from an area 200 km northeast of the epicenter, whereas
low‐frequency energy came from a location closer to the epicenter. The Tohoku earthquake shows strong frequency
dependence in the dip direction. High‐frequency sources
were located about 100 km west of the epicenter, while
low‐frequency sources were around epicenter, near the Japan
Trench. We compare the spatial distributions of energy with
estimates of seismic coupling before the earthquakes. Areas
of high‐frequency radiation seem correlated with regions that
were strongly coupled before the earthquakes. Areas of high
coupling, may be associated with fault properties that are
more heterogeneous and/or have overall higher stress, producing higher frequency seismic waves. Citation: Wang, D.,

showed that the largest slip occurred near the hypocenter or
farther east toward the Japan Trench. In contrast, back
projection results using teleseismic data which emphasized
the higher frequency content showed sources of radiation that
were primarily on the deeper portion of the fault west of the
hypocenter [Ishii, 2011; Wang and Mori, 2011]. A frequency
dependence in the spatial distribution of energy was also
recognized following the 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake by
Kiser and Ishii [2011].
[4] In order to investigate the frequency‐dependency radiation of these two earthquakes, we carried out back projections
analyses for the 2010 Maule and 2011 Tohoku earthquakes
using data in different frequency bands. The spatial distributions of the energy radiation are compared to the pre‐
earthquake estimates of seismic coupling on the fault and a
possible correlation is suggested between the locked state of
the fault and the energy radiation during the earthquakes.

2. Methods and Data

1. Introduction
[2] In large earthquakes, the severe high‐frequency strong
ground motions (1 to 10 Hz) and large amplitude low‐
frequency (0.01 to 0.2 Hz) waves have usually been thought
to originate from generally the same areas on the fault [e.g.,
Somerville et al., 1999; Irikura and Miyake, 2011], namely
the regions of large slip. This conclusion is based mainly on
detailed studies of crustal earthquakes, Recently, however,
the two great subduction earthquakes in Chile and Japan have
shown that there can be a strong frequency‐dependence to
the spatial distribution of the seismic radiation.
[3] Soon after the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku, Japan earthquake, it became apparent that there was a clear difference in
locations of the sources of the large amplitude high‐ and low‐
frequency radiation [Hara, 2011; Ide et al., 2011; Ishii, 2011;
Koketsu et al., 2011; Koper et al., 2011; Lay et al., 2011;
Simons et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2011]. Slip distribution models
from GPS [e.g., Ito et al., 2011], tsunami [e.g., Fujii et al.,
2011], and seismic [e.g., Shao et al., 2011] observations

[5] To study the spatial distribution of energy radiation
using a consistent method for different frequency bands, we
use the back‐projection method [e.g., Ishii et al., 2005]. This
technique estimates the source locations of the radiated
energy for time windows of the P‐wave using slant stacks of
array data. The travel time for each station in the stack were
calculated using the theoretical travel times from the station
to the grid point, using the software TauP [Crotwell et al.,
1999] and the velocity structure IASPEI 1991 [Kennett
and Engdahl, 1991].
[6] The observed P‐wave data were filtered into three frequency bands. High‐frequency data were derived with a 1.0 Hz
2 pole Butterworth high‐pass filter. Intermediate‐frequency
data were derived by using 2‐pole Butterworth filters with
corner frequencies at 0.2 and 1.0 Hz. Low‐frequency data
were derived with a 0.2 Hz 2 pole Butterworth low‐pass filter.
Station corrections were determined using cross correlations
to align the first 6 seconds of all the data on the initial arrival.
The locations of the sources of radiation were determined
relative to the fixed epicenter determined by United States
Geological Survey (USGS) for the Maule earthquake and
Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) for the Tohoku earthquake. A slightly different procedure was used to determine
the stations corrections for the low‐frequency data of the
Tohoku earthquake, as described below.
[7] Kiser and Ishii [2011] carried out a similar frequency‐
dependent analysis for the Maule earthquake, with results
which are consistent this study. Also, Ishii [2011] studied
the Tohoku earthquake using the same methodology, but the
distinct spatial distributions for the high and low frequency
radiation are not as clear as in our study. As pointed out by

Figure 1. Grid locations tested for each time window in the back projection analyses of the (left) 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake and (right) 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake. Red stars show the epicenters and focal mechanisms are from USGS
(Maule earthquake) and JMA (Tohoku earthquake).
Ishii [2011], the resolution is poorer for the low‐frequency
data due to the longer wavelengths. Also, for the Tohoku
earthquake the small initial arrivals, especially at the low
frequencies, make it even more difficult to accurately set the
important station corrections. To improve the resolution of
the low‐frequency results for the Tohoku earthquake, we
used the Mw7.3 foreshock as an empirical correction for the
mainshock. The foreshock occurred on March 9 about 60 km
north of the mainshock epicenter. A back‐projection analysis
using the low‐frequency data (low‐pass filtered at 0.2 Hz) of
the foreshock shows a simple spatial maximum with dimensions of about 20 km. The position of this maximum was
fixed to the centroid location given by the Global‐CMT
moment tensor solution (38.58N 142.82E) and station corrections were calculated for the foreshock waveforms. These
station corrections were then applied to the mainshock data
and the locations of the mainshock energy radiation were
determined relative to the foreshock centroid location. This
procedure gave more stable results for the low‐frequency
back‐projection. For example, the results had smaller dependence on the data window length.
[8] Our analyses use broadband vertical components from
USArray stations, which are located in the southwest and
central regions of the United States. We used 451∼572 P‐wave
recordings at distances of 65 to 96 degrees for the Maule and
310∼420 P‐wave recordings at distances of 65 to 96 degrees
for the Tohoku earthquake, depending on the coherences of
the beginning 6 s and the availability of the foreshock seismograms for the Tohoku earthquake in the low frequency
band. The USArray is not located close to a nodal plane for
the focal mechanisms of either earthquake, so the waveform
data should have stable amplitudes. For the back‐projection

calculation, we set a horizontal grid of 61 × 26 points (600 ×
300 km2) with a strike of 17.5° for the Maule earthquake, and
set a grid of 61 × 21 points (600 × 160 km2) with a strike of
15° for the Tohoku earthquake (Figure 1) covering the source
regions inferred from the aftershock distributions.

3. Results
[9] Figure 2 shows the summed values over all time windows of the squared amplitudes at each grid point, for the
three frequency bands of data for both earthquakes. This value
can be roughly interpreted as proportional to the radiated
energy. For both earthquakes the back projection results show
clear differences in the spatial patterns of the energy radiation
at different frequencies.
[10] In the Maule earthquake, the differences are mostly
along strike. Centroids for the high‐ and intermediate‐ frequency waves are located about 200 km north‐northeast of
the epicenter. The high‐frequency results can track the propagation of the rupture front. The rupture propagates at a speed
of about 2.9 km/s mainly to the north and can be seen in
Animation S1 of the auxiliary material.1 Different from the
region of high‐frequency radiation, the centroid of the low‐
frequency radiation lies about 100 km north‐northeast of the
epicenter well separated from the region of high‐frequency
radiation. This region of the low‐frequency energy corresponds to the area of large displacement on the fault in many
of the slip distribution models [e.g., Lorito et al., 2011].
[11] While the Maule earthquake showed differences
along strike, the Tohoku earthquake shows large frequency‐

dependent differences in the dip direction. The centroid of
the high‐frequency radiation is located west (down‐dip) of
the hypocenter, while the centroid of the low‐frequency
energy is around the epicenter and extend to the shallow
updip portion. The location of the intermediate‐ frequency
radiation lies in between. The downdip location west of the
hypocenter for the high‐frequency radiation is consistent
with numerous other studies that identify sources of the high‐
frequency radiation from the onshore strong‐motion data
[e.g., Kurahashi and Irikura, 2011] and teleseismic data [e.g.,
Ishii, 2011; Zhang et al., 2011]. (Although Furumura et al.
[2011] show possible high‐frequency sources east of the
hypocenter.) The updip location of the low‐frequency radiation is generally consistent with the region of largest slip
identified in many slip distribution models using tsunami,
geodetic, and seismic data [e.g., Shao et al., 2011; Fujii et al.,
2011]. The rupture propagation inferred for high‐frequency
radiation shows an initial slow propagation toward the
northwest at about 1.5 km/s then the rupture progresses
down the fault to the southwest at about 3.0 km/s, as seen
in Animation S2 of the auxiliary material.
[12] Figure 3 shows the time progressions of the back
projection results. The time position and stack amplitude for
each time step of the three frequency bands are plotted in
these figures. For the Maule earthquake (Figure 3, top) the
time propagation for the three frequency bands is rather
similar toward the north, however the regions of the maxi-

mum amplitude are quite different. The top middle figure
shows the summed amplitudes as a function of latitude,
where it can be seen that there are large amplitudes for the
high‐ and intermediate‐frequency data near 34°S while the
large amplitudes for the low‐frequency data are farther south
around 35°S.
[13] For the Tohoku earthquake (Figure 3, bottom), one
can clearly see the separate, nearly parallel regions for the
radiation of the three frequency bands. The high‐frequency
sources are originating along the deeper downdip edge of
the fault plane, the intermediate‐frequency sources are in the
middle region, and the low‐frequency sources are around
the epicenter and extend to the shallow updip portion. The
observed P‐wave amplitudes are proportional to moment,
and if the results are converted to fault displacements, large
values near the trench will be further emphasized because of
the lower velocities at shallower depth [Lay et al., 2011].

4. Resolution of Locations
[14] The results of this study depend on the accuracy of
the locations for the radiation sources in the three frequency
bands. We considered several factors that may affect our
location estimates.
[15] We tested six different stacking windows lengths
(10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s, and 40 s) to estimate the source
locations for the three different frequency bands, as shown in

Tohoku earthquake. The top middle figure shows the summed amplitudes as a function of latitude for the Maule earthquake.
The figures on the right show the regions of seismic coupling before the two earthquakes. Thin and thick red ellipses enclose
the region of 75% and 85% coupling, respectively. Coupling data for the Maule earthquake are taken from Moreno et al.
[2010] and for the Tohoku earthquake from Suwa et al. [2006]. Areas of strong coupling shown by the red lines appear to
correlate with sources of high‐frequency radiation. Blue dashed lines show areas of less coupling and large slip during the
earthquake. Black stars show the epicenters.
Figures S1 and S2 of the auxiliary material. We performed
a synthetic check using an empirical Green’s function
method (see detailed explanation in the auxiliary material).
The results show that the location uncertainties in the
different frequency data back projections are about 20 km
or less (Figures S3 and S4 of the auxiliary material). The
empirical station corrections for the low‐frequency Tohoku
data used the Mw7.3 foreshock data. We also carried out
the same procedure using a nearby Mw7.0 aftershock. The
resultant locations of the mainshock energy radiation are
quite similar (Figures S5 and S6 of the auxiliary material).

5. Correlation of Areas of High‐Frequency
Radiation and Strong Seismic Coupling
[16] Moreno et al. [2010] show a high‐resolution image of
the pre‐seismic locked state of the plate interface for the
source region of the 2010 Maule earthquake from a decade of
GPS data. The degree to which the fault is locked (seismic
coupling) tells us how much stress is being accumulated on
the fault, and thus should be related to the amount of slip and

energy radiation that occurs at the time of a large earthquake.
If we compare their pre‐locked areas (strong coupling) with
our frequency‐dependent energy distributions, we can see a
correlation with the regions of high‐frequency radiation
(Figure 3). Also, the source area of low‐frequency radiation
(and large fault displacement) appears to correlate with a
region of relatively less coupling. This is somewhat surprising
since simple elastic models imply that areas of strong coupling should have large slip.
[17] For the source region of the Tohoku earthquake, Suwa
et al. [2006] show a large area of strong coupling located west
of the epicenter (Figure 3). Similar to the Maule earthquake,
the area of high frequency radiation may be related to this
pre‐locked area. The area of large displacement and low‐
frequency radiation around the epicenter, may be associated
with an area on the shallow part of the fault that may not have
been coupled as strongly.
[18] There are other models for the seismic coupling in the
Tohoku area. The regional distribution shown by Loveless
and Meade [2010] also shows higher coupling in the region
west of the hypocenter, but the correlation with areas of high‐

frequency is not as clear. One problem is that the area of large
slip for the Tohoku earthquakes is relatively far offshore
where it is difficult to resolve the preseismic deformation
from onshore GPS observations.

6. Discussion
[19] The connection between seismic coupling and high‐
frequency radiation may be reasonable since stronger coupling
implies higher stress. Higher stress before the earthquake
could produce higher stress drops during the earthquake,
which would result in larger ground accelerations. In simple
elastic fault models and propagation, ground acceleration is
proportional to stress drop. Also, regions of higher stress may
have more stress heterogeneity, which would also contribute
to the high‐frequency radiation. It is more difficult to explain
why the slip during the earthquake can be larger in the areas
of lower coupling. Back‐slip models [e.g., Savage, 1983]
are often used to estimate the amount of slip in future earthquakes and assume that there will be larger slip in areas that
have higher strain rates and higher coupling. For the Tohoku
earthquake, this is an especially important issue, since it was
previously thought that the shallow portion of the megathrust
was not strongly coupled and therefore would not have large
slip. The Maule, and possibly Tohoku, earthquakes seem
to indicate that even a region with relatively low seismic
coupling can produce larger slip. If this is true, there are
other important considerations that can strongly control the
amount of slip during an earthquake, such as the related
effects of fault friction, complete stress drop, and rupture
dynamics.
[20] Difference in the frequency content for the seismic
waves is an important factor for understanding the damage
caused by large earthquakes. Kiser and Ishii [2011] pointed
out that the areas of low‐frequency radiation are likely to be
more tsunamigenic, which was clearly the case for the Tohoku
earthquake. Also, the Tohoku earthquake produced ground
motions with large high‐frequency accelerations but more
moderate amplitudes at 0.5 to 1.0 Hz [e.g., Si et al., 2011].

The latter is the frequency range important for damage to one
and two story wooden structures. This observation seemed
somewhat puzzling at first, since one would expect large low‐
frequency amplitudes and relatively smaller high‐frequency
amplitudes for a large earthquake with large shallow slip
located far offshore. However, the frequency characteristics
of the strong ground motions can be well explained if the
high‐frequency sources are on the deeper down‐dip portion
of the faults plane (closer to land), as was shown in this study.

7. Conclusions
[21] The results from the two recent great earthquakes in
Chile and Japan show that there can be a spatially different
pattern to the high‐ and low‐frequency radiation from the
fault plane of an earthquake. The Maule earthquake shows
lateral differences along strike for the sources of the high‐
and low‐frequency energy radiation, whereas the Tohoku
earthquake shows strong differences in the dip direction
(Figure 4). This frequency dependence in the radiation may
be associated with the seismic coupling on the fault prior to
the earthquake. Areas of high coupling, may be more heterogeneous and/or have an overall higher stress level so that
these regions are more likely to produce higher frequency
radiation.
