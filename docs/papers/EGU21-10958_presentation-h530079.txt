Adapted from Rolland et al. 2013

We see a larger amplitude northward, modeling shows it is due to the plasma drift along geomagnetic field lines

Summary and conclusions
Worldwide TEC analysis of 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake (Chile):
• Clear near-source coseismic signal (forced by instantaneous
deformation, rupture and surface waves)
• Absence of Rayleigh waves TEC signal at teleseismic distance: need for
higher rate GNSS data
• Absence of clear GW resonances
• Absence of clear AW resonances
• Clear tsunami signal offshore Hawaii and Japan, signature with the
largest extent
Manual inspection, need for more automated processing
Modeling supports the analysis
• Phase discrimination in data
• Northward directivity
• not consistent with the bilateral rupture propagation
• main driver: the plasma drift along Geomagnetic field lines

Our analysis shows:
• Clear near-source coseismic signal (forced by
instantaneous deformation, rupture and surface waves)
• Strong northward directivity
• Absence of GW and AW resonances (seen after 2011
Mw9.0 earthquake)
• Absence of Rayleigh waves TEC signal at teleseismic
distance: need for higher rate GNSS data
• Clear tsunami signal offshore Hawaii and Japan,
signature with the largest extent
Manual inspection, need for more automated processing
