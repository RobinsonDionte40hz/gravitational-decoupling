[1] It has previously been suggested that ionospheric
perturbations triggered by large dip-slip earthquakes might
offer additional source parameter information compared to
the information gathered from land observations. Based on
3D modeling of GPS- and GLONASS-derived total
electron content signals recorded during the 2011 Van
earthquake (thrust, intra-plate event, Mw = 7.1, Turkey),
we conﬁrm that coseismic ionospheric signals do contain
important information about the earthquake source,
namely its slip mode. Moreover, we show that part of
the ionospheric signal (initial polarity and amplitude
distribution) is not related to the earthquake source, but is
instead controlled by the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the
geometry of the Global Navigation Satellite System
satellites constellation. Ignoring these non-tectonic effects
would lead to an incorrect description of the earthquake
source. Thus, our work emphasizes the added caution that
should be used when analyzing ionospheric signals for
earthquake source studies. Citation: Rolland, L. M.,

1. Introduction
[2] Part of the seismic energy radiated by earthquakes is
transferred, through dynamic coupling, to the surrounding
ﬂuid envelopes (ocean and/or atmosphere). The sudden,
piston-like motion of the Earth’s surface creates atmospheric
acoustic-gravity waves. Due to the exponential decrease in
air density with height in the atmosphere, the wave amplitude
increases exponentially as they propagate towards the
ionosphere. There, the atmospheric (neutral) waves set the
plasma into motion that in turn induces perturbations in

electron density. Dip-slip earthquakes of magnitude M > 7
are expected to induce total electron content (TEC) ﬂuctuations detectable using nearby dual-frequency GPS receivers
[Calais and Minster, 1995; Heki and Ping, 2005]. Inclined
receiver-satellite line-of-sights (LOS) can sound the ionosphere far from the receivers (up to ~250 km), and hence in
broad zones above an epicenter, whether those zones are
inland or offshore [Astafyeva et al., 2011].
[3] A few studies have conﬁrmed that ionospheric signals
contain information on large dip-slip earthquakes. For
instance, Heki et al. [2006] suggested that the ionospheric
GPS data resolve the lateral extent and segmentation of the
2004 Mw = 9.1 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake rupture.
Astafyeva and Heki [2009] analyzed coseismic GPS-derived
TEC disturbances detected after three dip-slip earthquakes
offshore Japan. Comparing the ionospheric observations
with the coseismic displacements at the ground surface, they
suggested that the ionospheric waveforms markedly depend
on the focal mechanism of the earthquakes. This led the
authors to propose that the ﬁrst disruption of the ionosphere
might be similar to the motion of the neutral atmosphere
induced by the seismic rupture. Would such a hypothesis
be conﬁrmed, it would imply that the ground surface
deformation that is induced by a large dip-slip earthquake
might be inferred from its imprint in the ionosphere.
[4] Yet the question remains posed: Is the ﬁrst disruption
of the ionosphere similar to the motion of the neutral atmosphere that is induced by a seismic rupture? More broadly,
which robust information on the earthquake source do the
ionospheric signals contain? Answering these questions is
especially important in the context of exploding ionospheric
sounding capabilities offered by new (GLONASS) and
future (Compass/Beidou and Galileo) Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) observations.
[5] In the present study, we investigate the Mw = 7.1, 23
October 2011, Van earthquake, Eastern Turkey, that
occurred in conditions ideal to examine the questions we
pose. The event is a well-instrumented thrust and hence
dip-slip earthquake that ruptured a ~40 km-long fault with a
fairly simple geometry. It occurred inland, and hence in
conditions where the ionospheric signals have no interference with any tsunami-induced ionospheric perturbations
[Kakinami et al., 2012]. Thanks to nearby GNSS continuous
networks in Turkey and Iran, the ionospheric disturbances
were measured in the vicinity of the rupture area with
both an unprecedently complete azimuthal coverage and
various LOS conﬁgurations (Figure 1). We perform 3D
modeling of the ionospheric coupling, taking into account
the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the geometry of the satellites

constellation [e.g., Heki and Ping, 2005; Rolland et al.,
2011]. The comparison between the model, the TEC observations, and the earthquake parameters inferred on land,
leads to isolate the source parameters that are effectively
resolved in the ionosphere.

2. The 23 October 2011 Van Earthquake
[6] On 23 October 2011, the Mw = 7.1 Van earthquake
occurred in Eastern Turkey, in the collision zone between
the Arabian and the Eurasian plates (epicenter at 43.48 E;
38.62 N, 10h41m21s UT). The earthquake caused destructive shaking and was felt throughout South Caucasus and
up to the Levant region more than ~1000 km away. The
rupture broke a reverse-slip fault and strikes WestSouthwest overall [Elliott et al., 2013]. The focal depth of
the earthquake is estimated around 16–20 km, with the
rupture having propagating both up dip and along strike
to the west [U.S. Geological Survey reports]. The modeling of the seismological and geodetic data (InSAR and GPS)
ﬁnd that the rupture produced 3 to 9 m of vertical slip at depth,
that sustained a ~1 m uplift north of the fault trace [Figure 1a,
Elliott et al., 2013 and Fielding et al., in rev.].

3. Data Processing and Analysis
3.1. GNSS-TEC Data Processing
[7] Figure 1a shows the location of the GNSS receivers
used in the study and the tracks of the GLONASS and GPS
satellites R17 and G21, G29 and G30 at the time of the earthquake. We use GPS and GLONASS data from nine receivers
of the Continuously Operating Reference Stations Turkish
permanent network (Tusaga-Aktif; data available at http://
supersites.earthobservations.org/van.php). We also use GPS
data from nine receivers of the Iranian Permanent GPS
Network for Geodynamics (IPGN). In both data sets, the
sample interval is 30 s. Both the stations and satellites

coverage offer ionospheric sounding directly above, and
broadly around, the epicentral area.
[8] We extracted biased slant TEC time series from the
phase differences of the two carrier frequencies. The latter
are identical for all GPS satellites (f1 = 1575.42 MHz and
f2 = 1227.60 MHz), but vary with the channel number K for
GLONASS satellites (f1 = 1602 + K x 0.5625 MHz and
f2 = 1246 + K x 0.4375 MHz, with K selected in the range
[7 6]) (GLONASS Interface Control Document).
Ionospheric daily variations and instrumental biases are
removed using a zero-phase third-order ﬁnite impulse
response Butterworth ﬁlter from 2 mHz to 8 mHz (half the
Nyquist frequency). The frequency bandwidth is chosen to
highlight the acoustically resonant signal (acoustic cutoff
frequency ~4.4 mHz) [Dautermann et al., 2009].
3.2. Coseismic Ionospheric Pattern
[9] We locate the slant TEC variation measurements and
correct them to vertical TEC after Rolland et al. [2011].
The ionosphere is considered as a thin shell that intersects
the satellite-receiver raypaths at Ionospheric Pierce Points
(IPP). The altitude of the ionospheric thin layer is set up at
the height of maximum electron density hmF2 = 280 km
given by the IRI model for the local conditions [Bilitza and
Reinisch, 2008]. The ionospheric perturbation is found to
appear at the LOS SIRN-R17 470 s (+/15s) after the earthquake, then to propagate radially at ~1 km/s from the epicentral area (Figure 1b), with a maximum peak amplitude of 0.25
TECU (1 TECU = 1016 electrons/m2). This apparent velocity
is close to the sound speed at ionospheric heights. Thus, the
signal is consistent with the acoustic pressure wave triggered
by the earthquake and immediately launched in the surrounding atmosphere [Afraimovich et al., 2001]. The wave takes
two distinct shapes with opposite initial polarity: the usual
coseismic “N-wave” shape—a bipolar pulse with a positive
trailing part and a negative recovery part, and a one-phase
negative pulse shape (Figure 2a).

[10] To highlight the spatial distribution of the polarities,
we map the maximum value of the initial TEC change
(Figure 2b). The map reveals that the initial TEC changes
are positive South of the earthquake source, and negative
North of it (with the exception of LOS SIRN-R17 that
crosses the epicentral area from South to North). The map
also reveals that the most intense TEC changes occurs in
the NW and SE parts of the zone, i.e., the ionospheric signal
shows NW and SE directivity transverse to the WestSouthwest-striking rupture plane. Similar observations were
done for the 2008 Mw = 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake
[Afraimovich et al., 2010] and interpreted to attest for a link
between the rupture geometry and the ionospheric radiation
pattern transverse directivity. We test this suggestion below.

4. Modeling
[11] So far, the most successful attempts to model the nearsource earthquake [Heki and Ping, 2005; Heki et al., 2006] or
volcano-induced ionospheric disturbances [Dautermann
et al., 2009] are based on acoustic ray tracing and
atmosphere-ionosphere coupling. We thus follow this latter
strategy to examine the impact of the ionospheric coupling
and ionospheric sounding on the TEC signal polarity
and directivity.
[12] We ﬁrst model the neutral pressure waveﬁeld from a
point-like compressional motion. For that, we follow the
method by Dautermann et al. [2009] that we extend to a
3D spherical regular grid in order to compute the coseismic
ionospheric perturbation [Rolland et al., 2011]. The arrival
time (tarrival), wave vector (k), and ampliﬁcation factor that
is related to the geometrical spreading and the kinetic energy
conservation are computed using acoustic ray tracing [Dessa
et al., 2005] for a stratiﬁed atmosphere. After the parameters
along rays are interpolated to the regular 3D grid (Figure 3a),
the ray amplitude is convolved with an N-wave shape source
function [Heki and Ping, 2005; Dautermann et al., 2009] that
describes the time evolution of the coupled neutral acoustic
wave particle velocity at ground level:

vðt Þ ¼

A 2

(1)

where t0 is the time of maximum motion, s is the pulse width,
and A is the initial amplitude factor.
[13] While the acoustic wave is propagating in the atmosphere, its phase and amplitude are affected by frequencydependent viscous and thermal losses. As we are concerned
with the waveform shape, we must include these effects,
and we do it in an ad-hoc way. First, we parameterize the
broadening of the pulse that is due to the dispersion, following the approach proposed by Dautermann et al. [2009]. At a
given location r, the neutral particle velocity u(t,r) is a symmetric bipolar pulse whose width varies linearly as s(t,r) =
btarrival(r). Second, we compute the viscous attenuation effects on the amplitude following Garcia et al. [2005], assuming a 5 mHz monochromatic wave.
[14] Finally, we incorporate the neutral-plasma coupling
effect following the scheme proposed by Rolland et al.
[2011]. We assume that the ion particle velocity vi is
vi = (vn  1B)1B, where vn = uk is the neutral perturbation
velocity vector derived from the previous steps, and 1B is the
geomagnetic ﬁeld unit vector [Hooke, 1970]. Next we derive
the 3D electron density perturbation dNe by integrating the
linearized continuity equation for the electrons over time; we
neglect loss and production terms and assume that perturbations
are small compared to the ambient ionization density Ne0:
dN e ðt; rÞ ¼

Z t

[15] The 3D a priori ionization density Ne0 and local geomagnetic ﬁeld vector B are derived from the IRI and the
IGRF models, respectively. Ne0 reaches a maximum of
1.2  1012 electrons/m3 at 280 km height, and B has an inclination angle of ~56 (Figure 3a), and an easterly declination
of ~6 . In order to compare the model results with the
observations, we spatially integrate dNe along the GNSSsatellites raypaths.

5. Results and Discussion
[16] We focus our study on the ﬁrst 20 min after the earthquake to ensure that we capture the ﬁrst and main pulse related to the earthquake rupture. We apply the same ﬁltering
to the TEC synthetics and the GNSS-derived TEC time
series, and compare them (dTEC, Figure 2a). The modeled
and observed data show good agreement in arrival time,
waveform (correlation coefﬁcient of 0.86), and relative
amplitude for a pulse broadening factor b = 0.04 s1 and an
initial amplitude factor A = 1.2, both tuned by least-square
ﬁtting. Figure 2b compares the radiation pattern of actual
data and synthetics. This shows that both the polarity pattern
and the NW and SE directivity are well reproduced using
the compressional point source. Thus, the ionospheric
observations are consistent with a reverse-type rupture that

would have produced a surface uplift over a small spatial
extent. These inferences agree with inland seismological
(Figure 1b) and geodetic observations of the Van earthquake
[Elliott et al., 2013].
[17] To discriminate the parameters controlling the main
features of the observations—i.e., (1) reversed polarity across
the epicentral area (positive northward and negative southward) and (2) NW and SE directivity transverse to the rupture
plane—we investigate the intermediary steps of our model.
Thus, we present 2D snapshots of the spatial distribution of
the electron density perturbation (i.e., before the spatial integration step) with (Figures 3a and 3c) and without geomagnetic ﬁeld B (Figure 3b). For this latter case, we consider
that the neutrals and the ions are perfectly coupled everywhere, i.e., vi = vn. Figure 3e compares the waveforms of vn
with the waveforms of dNe in both cases (with and without

B) for selected latitudes. The waveforms are alike due above
and South of the epicenter, whereas in the North, dNe shows
the one-phase negative pulses. These latter result from phase
shifts occurring because the ion velocity divergence there is
signiﬁcant [Hooke, 1970].
[18] The synthetic ionospheric radiation pattern (Figure 3d)
further emphasizes the effects of B on the ionospheric
response. It shows an asymmetric antenna-like pattern—with
large positive dNe southward and smaller negative dNe northward. Southward, the particle velocity (vn) and B are parallel
(see Figure 3a), meaning that the coupling strength is maximum [Heki and Ping, 2005]. The NW and SE directivity
appears only at the ﬁnal spatial integration step, proving that
it relates to the satellites observation geometry and not to the
rupture strike itself.
[19] The approach can be applied for any geomagnetic
conﬁguration (see supporting information Table A1).
This shows that the geomagnetic ﬁeld markedly controls
the polarity of the very ﬁrst ionospheric perturbations.
Based on the analysis of three earthquakes, Astafyeva
and Heki [2009] suggested that the earthquake source
might be characterized by the polarity of the initial ionospheric perturbations. Our modeling nuances this suggestion: such a characterization can only be done in the
regions where the geomagnetic ﬁeld hardly distorts the
ionospheric response and thus lets it fairly resembling
the initial motion. In the Northern hemisphere, the geomagnetic ﬁeld effects are minimum due above and South
of the rupture line. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is opposite, and the distortions are minimum North of
the ruptures. This is conﬁrmed by the analysis of the
Mw = 8.8 2010 offshore Maule Chilean earthquake, for
which GPS-TEC observations show a negative initial
change South of the rupture and a positive initial change
North of it [see Figure 1c in Kakinami et al., 2012].
[20] To complement our source modeling, we performed a
spatial grid search to determine the location of the uplift point
source. We found this location, deﬁned by the minimum
data-model discrepancy, being at 43.5 E and 38.7 N
(Figure 2b), that is in the rupture area and less than 10 km
away from the zone of maximum uplift derived by Elliott
et al. [2013]. This result further validates our modeling
approach and its potential to constrain additional parameters
of the earthquake source.

6. Conclusions and Prospects
[21] We have investigated the initial polarity and amplitude distribution of near-ﬁeld coseismic ionospheric signals
observed after the 2011 Van earthquake, making use, for
the ﬁrst time, of both GPS and GLONASS capabilities. We
performed 3D modeling of the data taking into account the
effects of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the conﬁguration of the
satellites constellation. The modeling results show that (1)
the ionospheric observations are consistent with a reversetype rupture having produced a signiﬁcant uplift at the
ground surface (~1 m), (2) the polarity change observed on
either side of the rupture is primarily linked to geomagnetic
ﬁeld effects, not to the rupture properties, and (3) the NW
and SE directivity is primarily linked to the satellites geometry, not to the rupture geometry.
[22] Our work emphasizes the added caution that should be
used when analyzing ionospheric signals for earthquake

source studies. The proposed 3D modeling approach is, so
far, the most comprehensive reading of the GNSS-derived
TEC patterns. We suggest that this approach should be used
more broadly to interpret coseismic TEC observations in an
attempt to derive reliable constrains on the earthquake source.
[23] At present, we only model the ﬁrst and main part of
the ionospheric signal, but we expect that, in the forthcoming
years, we may succeed modeling the entire signal. This reﬁned modeling should lead recovering the major intrinsic
properties of the earthquake ruptures, such as their magnitude, their spatial extent, and the space and time evolution
of the coseismic vertical motions. This will complement
and thus improve our ability to properly characterize the
earthquake source and the related hazards. Because of the relatively short time for the ground perturbation to reach the
ionosphere (~8 min), these signals also have the potential to
serve in the design of reliable and cost-effective tsunami
early-warning systems.
