Abstract
Like 1 Hz waves occurring in the upstream of various celestial bodies in the solar system, 1 Hz narrowband
whistler-mode waves are often observed around the Moon. However, wave properties have not been thoroughly
investigated, which makes it difﬁcult to proclaim the generation mechanism of the waves. Using 5.5 yr wave data
from ARTEMIS, we perform a detailed investigation of 1 Hz waves in the near-lunar space. The amplitude of lunar
1 Hz waves is generally 0.05–0.1 nT. In the geocentric solar ecliptic coordinates, the waves show no signiﬁcant
regional differentiation pattern but show an absence inside the magnetosphere. Correspondingly, in the
selenocentric solar ecliptic coordinates, the wavescan occur extensively at ∼1.1–12 RL, while few events are
observed in the lunar wake due to a lack of interaction with the solar wind. Furthermore, the wave distributions
exhibit modest day–night and dawn–dusk asymmetries but less apparent north–south asymmetry. Compared with
the nightside, more intense waves with lower peak wave frequency are present on the dayside. The preferential
distribution of 1 Hz waves exhibits a moderate correlation with strong magnetic anomalies. The waves propagate
primarily at wave normal angles <60° with an ellipticity of [−0.8, −0.3]. For stronger wave amplitudes and lower
latitudes, 1 Hz waves generally have smaller wave normal angles and become more left-hand circularly polarized.
Owing to the unique interaction between the Moon and solar wind, our statistical results might provide new
insights into the generation mechanism(s) of 1 Hz waves in planetary plasma environments and promote the
understanding of lunar plasma dynamics.

observations from various spacecraft, including Wind (Farrell
et al. 1996), Lunar Prospector (hereafter referred to as “LP”;
Lin et al. 1998), Geotail (Nakagawa et al. 2003), Kaguya
(Tsugawa et al. 2011), etc. Although numerous studies have
been performed for several decades, the generation of 1 Hz
waves has not been clariﬁed yet. In general, the major
candidates in driving the excitation of 1 Hz waves near the
Moon are ions reﬂected by lunar magnetic anomalies (Tsugawa
et al. 2011; Harada et al. 2015) and solar wind interactions with
lunar crustal magnetic ﬁelds (Halekas et al. 2006, 2008).
Halekas et al. (2006) statistically analyzed the lunar 1 Hz
narrowband whistlers using about 1.5 yr of data from the LP,
which orbits at ∼100 km altitude from the lunar surface. Their
results showed that 1 Hz waves are observed at an occurrence
rate of ∼6.6%, with the regions where the waves often
occuroutside the lunar wake in the solar wind. The 1 Hz waves
exhibit typical propagating and polarizing features of whistlermode waves. In addition, the waves are closely related to
external magnetic enhancements and crustal magnetic ﬁelds.
Tsugawa et al. (2011) updated the results using 1 yr of data
from Kaguya, which orbits in the polar orbit of the Moon at an
altitude of about 100 km. Their study revealed that the 1 Hz
narrowband whistlers tend to occur at a high (40°–90°) solar
zenith angle (SZA). The distributions of 1 Hz waves exhibit
considerable north–south and dawn–dusk asymmetries.
Furthermore, waves with strong amplitude are typically
observed near the lunar crustal magnetic anomalies.
This study comprehensively investigates the spatial distributions and propagating properties of lunar 1 Hz waves. The

1. Introduction
One hertz waves are whistler-mode waves observed near
1 Hz in the spacecraft frame with narrowband spectra. The
narrowband spectra structure is possibly caused by the upper
cutoff limited by upstream propagating in the solar wind and
the upward slope resulting from the Doppler-shift of power-law
spectra (Russell 2007). It is also reported by Tsugawa et al.
(2014) that narrowband spectra can be formed by groupstanding for 1 Hz waves near the Moon.
One hertz waves have been observed extensively in the
upstream of many solar system bodies, including both
planetary bodies with and without intrinsic magnetic ﬁelds,
i.e., Earth, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus
and at interplanetary bow shocks (Heppner et al. 1967; Russell
et al. 1971; Russell 2007; Fairﬁeld 1974; Smith et al. 1989;
Orlowski et al. 1990; Smith et al. 1991; Orlowski et al. 1992;
Tsurutani et al. 1993; Brain et al. 2002; Ruhunusiri et al. 2018;
Xiao et al. 2020). These waves are also called “narrowband
whistlers” or “upstream whistler waves.” In addition, the
Moon, which has neither a global-scale magnetic ﬁeld nor a
dense atmosphere, provides a representative example of the
interaction between the solar wind and an unmagnetized, airless
body with ﬂowing plasma (Schubert & Lichtenstein 1974).
Near the Moon, 1 Hz waves have also been reported based on

outline of this paper is organized as follows. We brieﬂy
introduce the instruments and selection criteria in Section 2.

deﬁned as solar wind ions. The rest are nonsolar wind ions
(Harada et al. 2015). We can see from Figures 1(a) and (b) that
during the observed time period, the ﬂuxes of ions at tens of eV
to about 1 keV experience moderate enhancement. As shown in
Figure 1(c), 1 Hz waves are observed from ∼04:38 to 05:30 UT,
with the wave power peaking at approximately 1.4 Hz. The
bottom black curve and top black curve in Figure 1(c) indicate
fcp and 2fcp, respectively, where fcp is the proton cyclotron
frequency. The corresponding wave normal angle (Figure 1(d))
and ellipticity (Figure 1(e)) exhibit that the waves propagate
quasiparallelly with left-handed polarization. Figure 1(f) shows
the power-weighted wave normal angle (red cross) and ellipticity
(blue cross). For each wave event, the power-weighted wave
normal angle (ellipticity) is deﬁned as (Yu et al. 2017)

2. Instrumentation and Event Selection
The Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moonʼs Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS;
Angelopoulos 2011) mission consists of two identical satellites
(P1 and P2) originating from the two outermost satellites (THB
and THC) of the THEMIS mission (Angelopoulos 2008). The
two repositioned ARTEMIS satellites travel around the Moon
in near-ecliptic orbit with an inclination below ∼30°.
Speciﬁcally, the orbits of ARTEMIS probes have a period of
∼26 hr with selenocentric distances ∼1.1–12 RL (geocentric
distances of ∼55–65 RE), where RL and RE are the radii of the
Moon and Earth, respectively. As a result, ARTEMIS can
provide unprecedented comprehensive observations of various
plasma environments, including distant magnetotail, the solar
wind, lunar space, and planetary space.
In this study, we obtain the wave spectra by applying the fast
Fourier transformation to the magnetic ﬁeld data provided by
the ﬂuxgate magnetometer (FGM; Auster et al. 2008). The
processed data have a frequency coverage of ∼0.016–8 Hz
with a time resolution of 32 s. Using ARTEMIS P2 data from
2016 January 1 to 2021 July 1, we perform a detailed statistical
study on the spatial distributions and wave properties of 1 Hz
waves.
The criteria adopted to select the 1 Hz waves are as follows:

fmax

áWNAñ =

ò fmin WNA ( f ) BPSD ( f ) df
fmax

ò fmin

,

BPSD ( f ) df

fmax

áEllipticityñ =

ò fmin Ellipticity ( f ) BPSD ( f ) df
fmax

ò fmin BPSD ( f ) df

,

(2 )

where the fmin and fmax are the minimum and maximum
frequencies of 1 Hz waves, respectively. WNA( f ),
Ellipticity( f ), and BPSD ( f ) are the wave normal angle,
ellipticity, and power spectral density as function of frequency
at each event time, respectively.
As illustrated by Figure 1(f), the power-weighted wave
normal angle of the 1 Hz waves is mainly 20°–40°, and the
power-weighted ellipticity is generally [−0.7, −0.6], indicating
that the wave properties are consistent with the typical whistlermode waves. Figure 1(g) exhibits the wave amplitude obtained
by integrating the magnetic ﬁeld wave power over 0.6–4 Hz.
As we can see, the integrated wave amplitude of this event is
generally >0.6 nT, with the peak wave amplitude of about
1.5 nT. As indicated by Figures 1(f) and (g), our wave selection
criterion of drop level >20 dB is stringent; therefore, it would
lead to an underestimation of wave occurrence.
Using this well-established wave database, we further
explore the statistical properties of 1 Hz waves.

1. We search the peak of power spectral density in the
frequency range of 0.6–4 Hz, where the lower limit of
0.6 Hz is adopted to avoid spin tones up to the second
harmonics (Harada et al. 2015), and the upper limit of
4 Hz is adopted following previous studies (Halekas et al.
2006; Tsugawa et al. 2011).
2. The peak of power spectral density should be greater than
0.01 nT2 Hz−1 to avoid noise contamination.
3. To exclude the broadband magnetic turbulence, the drop
level, deﬁned as the ratio between the peak intensity and
the minimum intensity in the frequency range of
0.6 Hz–fpeak, should be greater than 20 dB, where fpeak
is the frequency of peak intensity (Tsugawa et al. 2011).
4. Since the waves are mainly left-handed polarized, we
focus on wave events with ellipticity <0 for the accuracy
of calculating wave amplitude.

3. Statistical Results
3.1. Spatial Distributions of 1 Hz Waves
Figures 2(a)–(b) show the spatial distributions of 1 Hz wave
amplitude in X–Y and X–Z planes of geocentric solar ecliptic
(GSE) coordinates, respectively, while Figures 2(c)–(d) exhibit
the results in the selenocentric solar ecliptic (SSE) coordinates.
The GSE coordinates are Earth-centered, with the X-axis
pointing from the Earth toward the Sun, the Z-axis paralleling
the north normal of the ecliptic plane, and the Y-axis
completing the orthogonal coordinate set. For SSE coordinates,
the deﬁnition is analogous to the GSE coordinates but Mooncentered. Every dot in the ﬁgures represents a 1 Hz wave event.
As shown in Figure 2, the amplitude of 1 Hz waves is generally
0.05–1 nT. For the wave distribution in the Earth-centered
system (Figures 2(a) and (b)), the wave occurrence and
amplitude exhibit no obvious dawn–dusk and north–south
asymmetries. It is noteworthy that 1 Hz waves disappear at
XGSE < ∼ −45 RE. This is consistent with a previous study,
which reported that 1 Hz waves are not capable of passing

For broadband magnetic turbulence at 0.1–10 Hz, the wave
frequency overlaps with the investigated 1 Hz waves. Therefore, we use visual inspection as a supplement to further ensure
the reliability of our established wave database. The wave
events which exhibit ambiguous wave features are excluded
from the database. Using the above criteria, we identify 3847
wave events over the 5.5 yr ARTEMIS data.
An example of 1 Hz waves identiﬁed by the above criteria is
shown in Figure 1. Figures 1(a) and (b) show the energy spectra
of all ions and nonsolar wind ions, respectively, which are
provided by the electrostatic analyzer (ESA; McFadden et al.
2008). Ions with energy per charge 0.4ESW/e < E/q < 4ESW/e,
where ESW/e is the solar wind proton energy per charge, and
angles with respect to the solar wind velocity direction <45° are

through the magnetosheath (Russell 2007). As for the wave
distribution in the Moon-centered system (Figures 2(c) and
(d)), on the dayside, 1 Hz waves mainly occur near the Moon
(XSSE < ∼ 4 RL), and the wave strength of 1 Hz waves is most
intense in this region. On the nightside, 1 Hz waves occur
extensively with moderately stronger wave amplitudes near the
Moon (about or greater than 0.1 nT). As |XSSE| increases, the
waves generally occur closer to both sides of YSSE = 0. It
should be noted that 1 Hz waves cannot be observed in the
typical lunar wake region right behind the Moon. Furthermore,
2
2
= ∼11 RL, 1 Hz waves can be observed
at XSSE
+ YSSE
extensively with an occurrence peak in the midnight sector.
This wave occurrence at a large radial distance might be related
to the longer satellite dwelling time near the apoapsis. As
shown in Figure 2(d), in the X–Z plane of the SSE coordinates,
at |XSSE| < ∼4 RL, 1 Hz waves are generally observed near the
equator. As |XSSE| increases, the waves extend to higher

latitudes. At |XSSE| = 8–12 RL on the nightside, 1 Hz waves
often occur at high latitudes on both hemispheres.
Figure 3 exhibits the spatial distributions of the frequency of
peak power spectral density fpeak (hereafter referred to as peak
wave frequency) with the same format as Figure 2. As
illustrated in Figure 3, the peak wave frequency is mainly
located in the frequency range spanning 0.6–2 Hz, with a small
population of wave events peaking at frequencies up to 3–4 Hz.
In the Earth-centered system (Figures 3(a) and (b)), compared
with the dusk sector, 1 Hz waves have a slightly higher peak
wave frequency on the dawn sector of the Earth with averaged
peak frequency of 1.59 Hz and 1.68 Hz respectively, but day–
night (∼1.62 Hz) and north–south (1.63 and 1.61 Hz)
dependences are not observed for the peak wave frequency
of 1 Hz waves. For the peak wave frequency distribution in the
Moon-centered system, as shown in Figure 3(c), at a large
2

= 11 RL), the peak wave
radial distance ( XSSE
+ YSSE
frequency is slightly higher at the dawn sector. For waves at

small radial distances ( XSSE
< ∼ 6 RL), the peak
+ YSSE
wave frequency is higher on the nightside. Especially for wave
events near YSSE = 0, the peak wave frequencies are generally
>2 Hz. In the X–Z plane of SSE coordinates, the peak wave
frequency also exhibits signiﬁcant day–night asymmetry. In
addition, 1 Hz waves tend to have slightly higher peak wave
frequency in the Moonʼs northern hemisphere.
In Figure 4, we merge all available data and investigate the
wave properties in the longitude–latitude space with a
resolution of 10° × 4° for each bin, and the local time
corresponding to the longitude is shown by the red axes in
the ﬁgure. Figure 4(a) shows the number of total satellite
samples in each bin regardless of the presence of 1 Hz waves.
In each bin, the threshold of the total sample number is set to
100 to eliminate the inﬂuence of accidental events as much as
possible. Figure 4(b) displays the occurrence rates of 1 Hz
waves as functions of the longitude and latitude. The
occurrence rate in each bin is deﬁned as the ratio between
the number of 1 Hz wave events to the total number of satellite
samples regardless of the presence of 1 Hz waves. As shown in
Figure 4(b), it is preferable for 1 Hz waves to be observed on
the dawn sector (longitude range of ∼−150°–−60°) of the
Moon. In addition, the peak of occurrence rates occurs at high
latitudes (>20°) on both hemispheres, with occurrence rates up
to ∼8%. However, the corresponding number of satellite
samples in the high latitudes is not abundant enough, thus
decreasing the reliability of this result. Figure 4(c) shows the

rms wave amplitude distributions of 1 Hz waves in the
longitude–latitude space. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that
the amplitudes of 1 Hz waves are predominantly distributed in
the range of 0.05–1 nT. Speciﬁcally, 1 Hz waves are more
intense on the dayside (longitude equals −90°–90°), with
averaged wave amplitudes about or greater than ∼0.7 nT.
Furthermore, the wave amplitudes exhibit moderate dawn–
dusk and north–south asymmetries, with larger wave amplitude
at dawn and in the south. This distribution pattern is generally
consistent with that of strong magnetic anomalies, indicating a
correlation between 1 Hz waves and magnetic anomalies
(Tsugawa et al. 2011). Figure 4(d) illustrates the peak wave
frequency of 1 Hz waves as a function of the longitude and
latitude. One hertz waves tend to peak at a higher wave
frequency on the nightside than on the dayside, while no
obvious dawn–dusk and north–south asymmetries are
observed.
3.2. Wave Normal Angle and Ellipticity Distributions of 1 Hz
Waves
Figure 5 shows power-weight wave normal angle (Figures
5(a)–(c)) and ellipticity (Figures 5(d)–(f)) distributions of 1 Hz
waves on the dayside (blue bars) and nightside (red bars). From
left to right, the wave amplitudes are sorted into three intervals:
weak (0.03–0.1 nT), moderate (0.1–0.3 nT), and strong
(>0.3 nT). The occurrence rates are deﬁned as the ratio

distributions of 1 Hz waves in three different latitude intervals.
As shown in Figures 6(a)–(c), for all three latitude intervals
concerned, wave normal angles of 1 Hz waves are predominantly (>95%) distributed in the range of 0°–60° on both
dayside and nightside. As the latitude increases, high wave
normal angle waves tend to account for a slightly larger
proportion, i.e., the percentage of wave normal angles in 50°–
60° increases sharply from ∼5% on the dayside (∼12% on the
nightside) in near-lunar equator regions (<10°) to 20% on the
dayside (24% on the nightside) in high-latitude regions (>20°).
In addition, the wave normal angles of waves on the dayside
are slightly smaller than on the nightside. For power-weighted
ellipticity distributions shown in Figures 6(d)–(f), 1 Hz waves
generally have ellipticity in the range between −0.8 and −0.3.
As the latitude increases, the ellipticity of 1 Hz waves becomes
more linearly polarized. For instance, the occurrence of 1 Hz
waves at [−0.7, −0.6) considerably decreases from ∼56% in
near-lunar equatorial regions to ∼38% in high-latitudinal
regions. In the meantime, the occurrence of ellipticity in the
range of [−0.6, −0.4] moderately increases. Besides that, 1 Hz
waves are slightly more likely to be left-hand circularly
polarized on the dayside than on the nightside.

between the number of 1 Hz wave events in each wave normal
angle (ellipticity) bin and the total number of 1 Hz waves in the
designated amplitude level. The results of dayside and
nightside are calculated separately. As shown in Figure 5,
most (over 95%) power-weighted wave normal angles of 1 Hz
waves are located at 0°–60°. As the wave amplitudes increase,
the wave normal angles of 1 Hz waves tend to decrease.
Speciﬁcally, the percentage of waves with small wave normal
angled gradually increases, and that of large wave normal
angles decreases correspondingly. For weak 1 Hz waves
(0.03–0.1 nT), wave normal angles are distributed relatively
evenly over a range of 10°–50° (10°–60° for nightside waves)
with a percentage of ∼20% in each wave normal angle bin. For
strong waves ( 0.3 nT), wave normal angles are distributed
more concentratedly with the peak of occurrence rate (>30%)
located at 20°–30° and over ∼80% of the waves having a wave
normal angle of 10°–40°. Compared with nightside, dayside
waves generally have a smaller wave normal angle. The
ellipticities of 1 Hz waves (Figures 5(d)–(f)) are mainly
distributed in the range of [−0.8, −0.3]. As the wave strength
intensiﬁes, the waves tend to be more left-hand circularly
polarized, with the peak of occurrence rate accounting for
∼65% at smaller ellipticity ([−0.7, −0.6]). For weak and
moderate 1 Hz waves, dayside waves are slightly more lefthand circularly polarized, while nightside waves tend to be
more left-hand circularly polarized for strong waves.
In Figure 6 we further explore power-weighted wave normal
angle (Figures 6(a)–(c)) and ellipticity (Figures 6(a)–(c))

In this study, using 5.5 yr observational data from the
ARTEMIS P2 spacecraft, we have performed a detailed
statistical analysis of the spatial distributions of wave
occurrence, wave amplitude, and peak wave frequency for

lunar 1 Hz waves. Furthermore, we have comprehensively
investigated the wave normal angle and ellipticity features of
these 1 Hz emissions. Our principal conclusions are summarized as follows:
In the Earth-centered system: The wave amplitudes of lunar
1 Hz waves show no clear dawn–dusk and north–south
asymmetries. In addition, 1 Hz waves cannot be observed
inside the Earthʼs magnetosphere. For peak wave frequency,
the wave power of 1 Hz waves peaks at a slightly higher
frequency on the dawn sector while showing no clear
difference between day–night and north–south sectors.
In the Moon-centered system: (1) The amplitude of 1 Hz
waves is generally 0.05–1 nT. One hertz waves can be
observed over a broad range of 1.1–12 RL, with a major peak at
a small radial distance (<8 RL) and a secondary peak at a large
distance (>∼10 RL). Wave amplitudes are stronger and mainly
conﬁned closer to the Moon (<∼4 RL) on the dayside with
average values of >∼0.7 nT. In contrast, on the nightside, 1 Hz
waves can extend to a larger radial distance and generally occur
near YSSE = 0 except at XSSE < −10 RL. In addition, 1 Hz

waves cannot be observed in the lunar wake region due to a
lack of interaction with the solar wind.
(2) 1 Hz waves are more likely to occur at the dawn sector
(longitude = −150° to −60°) with peak occurrence rates of
∼8% at high-latitude regions. The amplitude of 1 Hz waves is
most intense on the dayside, with modest dawn−dusk and
north–south asymmetries, showing a similar distribution
pattern with strong magnetic anomalies. However, the peak
wave frequency is higher on the nightside.
(3) 1 Hz waves predominantly propagate at wave normal
angles <60° with ellipticity at [−0.8, −0.3]. As wave
amplitudes increase, wave normal angles decrease, and the
waves become more left-hand circularly polarized. The
increase in latitudes plays an opposite role.
Because some of the power spectra of 1 Hz waves do not
have a steep lower frequency cutoff, the selection criterion of
drop level >20 dB would exclude a certain number of waves
from our wave database, leading to the underestimation of
wave occurrence. According to our results, 1 Hz waves exhibit
clear wave normal angle dependence. Therefore, using wave
normal angle as a supplementary proxy for identifying 1 Hz

waves might help us obtain a more comprehensive understanding of 1 Hz waves.
Numerous studies have also been performed to analyze the
characteristics of 1 Hz waves in planetary bodies besides the
Moon (Fairﬁeld 1974; Orlowski & Russell 1991; Russell 2007;
Ruhunusiri et al. 2018, etc). Their results generally show that
1 Hz waves exhibit similar properties on these planets.
Speciﬁcally, 1 Hz waves mainly propagate at wave normal
angles < ∼55° to the magnetic ﬁeld with most commonly lefthanded polarization. The wave amplitude generally decreases
with increasing distance from the shock. Furthermore, the wave
frequencies decrease as the planets are located farther away
from the Sun. As shown in this paper, 1 Hz waves at the Moon
generally show similar wave features. Our results might imply
that although these planets and the Moon are of different sizes
and have different interactions with the solar wind, 1 Hz waves
in these plasma environments might share similar generating
mechanisms. Occurrence features and intensity distributions of
1 Hz waves in the selenographical coordinates indicate that
1 Hz waves often occur in regions with lunar magnetic
anomalies. Strong 1 Hz waves are signiﬁcantly associated with
strong magnetic anomalies (Halekas et al. 2006; Tsugawa et al.
2011). In addition, wave distributions in the SSE coordinates
have also been explored in these studies. Despite different
orbital coverage, our results of wave distributions exhibit
similar features in that the waves are rarely observed in the
wake regions, and the favorable occurrence regions of waves
with strong wave power are generally consistent in the

overlapping regions of satellite orbits. Consequently, our
results demonstrate a positive correlation between 1 Hz waves
and lunar crustal magnetic ﬁelds as well. In addition, as
reported by previous studies (Tsugawa et al. 2011; Harada et al.
2015), the generating mechanism of 1 Hz waves could be the
ions reﬂected by the lunar magnetic anomalies. This hypothesis
is also supported by observational results such as in Figure 1.
However, further numerical simulations are needed to quantitatively estimate the contribution of reﬂected ions to the
excitation of 1 Hz waves.
One hertz waves can be observed over a broad spatial range
in the lunar plasma environment. But the interactions between
1 Hz waves and particles lack systematical evaluation. It is also
suggested that the 1 Hz narrowband whistlers and the broadband whistler-mode waves can have the same wave source
(Tsugawa et al. 2012). To further understand the correlation
between these two wave modes, it is crucial to obtain detailed
global morphology and wave properties of broadband whistlermode waves and compare the similarities and differences
between these two wave modes, which is left as future work.
