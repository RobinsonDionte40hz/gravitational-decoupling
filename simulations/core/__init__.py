"""
Core gravitational decoupling physics modules.

This module contains the primary physics models for gravitational decoupling
via acoustic resonance, following SOLID principles with single-responsibility
focused implementations.

Modules:
--------
acoustic_physics:
    Foundation - SPL/pressure/force conversions, material properties
standing_wave_field:
    Continuous mode - 3D standing wave cavity (500W, 4.64% reduction)
impulse_toroidal_resonance:
    Impulse mode - Rhythmic excitation with toroidal circulation (100W avg, 4.99% reduction)
gravitational_decoupling_v2:
    Physics-grounded decoupling model
internal_resonance_device:
    Portable device design for massive blocks
resonant_power_model:
    Startup and maintenance power dynamics
