"""
Unified framework extensions - biological and consciousness systems.

This module contains extensions of the gravitational decoupling framework
to biological systems, ion channels, and consciousness studies. These
demonstrate the unified nature of frequency-energy coupling across scales
but are secondary to the primary gravitational focus.

Modules:
--------
biological_resonance:
    Ion channel frequencies, consciousness binding mechanisms
frequency_mass_scaling:
    Frequency-energy correspondence across scales
coupled_vs_shared_pattern:
    Channel manifestation patterns (simultaneous vs sequential)
