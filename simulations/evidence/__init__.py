Tohoku earthquake gravitational coupling evidence.

This module contains analysis of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake 38 mHz "mystery signal"
as potential evidence for gravitational coupling modulation at planetary scales.

Modules:
--------
analyze_tohoku_gps:
    Analysis of the 38 mHz signal from GNSS data
predict_tohoku_decoupling:
    Framework predictions for earthquake-induced gravitational coupling
